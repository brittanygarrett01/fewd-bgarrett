This is my README file. I use Wordpress to manage livemusiclou.com right now and while I like the layout, I thought I'd play around with other options we could use for the music blog in the future. 

I do not have any additional pages on here that are active right now other than the home page; however, I would like to continue trying to improve them in the future.
