This is my README file. I use Wordpress to manage livemusiclou.com right now and while I like the layout, I thought I'd play around with other options we could use for the music blog in the future. 

I do not have any additional pages on here that are active right now other than the home page; however, I would like to continue trying to improve them in the future. 

As far as the requirements:

-Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way based on what type of device the project is viewed from:
      I have a couple of media queries to manipulate the position of the columns, the order of content, and the layout of the hamburger menu
      
-Your project includes at least 3 custom CSS class and/or ID selectors which are applied to your HTML elements:
      I have A LOT of custom CSS classes. 

-Your project includes custom JavaScript including at least one JavaScript function:
      Devan (Thursday mentor) helped me with fetching Flickr photos using JavaScript. I also included code for a hamburger menu as another JavaScript function.
      
-Your code has some comments noting major portions of your code:
      I commented out the ends of my major sections/divs in my HTML to help see where everything was. In CSS, I commented out the major portions. And in JavaScript, I added some comments about what the functions were doing.
      
-Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository:
      You're here reading this so it's on GitHub!

-It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes a description of your project and - if necessary - any special instructions to run/view your project:
      And you're reading this README so again, YAY! :)
